Update 10/4/20 by Laith Hartary:
    Created HTML templates for each page of the website and
    pushed to github repository

Update 10/7/20 by Chris McHenry:
    Created Main.css, added link to Main.css in each HTML file.
    Main.css will act as the 'parent' of each css file.
    To minimize the amount of typing for each CSS file, just make general, site-wide adjustments to Main.css.
    Other CSS files should override Main.css automatically, but if not, we can force it to work.
